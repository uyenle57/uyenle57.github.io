<p>VCBT is an immersive Virtual Reality application that simulates the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) training environment. The application was built for Goldsmithsâ€™ Department of Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies and used for training CBT students.
<br/><br/>
The project motivation came from my personal struggles with stress, depression and anxiety in the past. This experience has led me to realise that almost everyone has struggled with mental health at least once at some point in their lives. Therefore I wanted to build a creative solution that can provide a faster, reliable and repeatable approach to CBT training with the hope to improve mental health treatments.
<br/><br/>
Built using Unity3D and runs on Oculus Rift CV1, the user would act as the therapist and communicate face-to-face with a virtual patient with the aim to alleviate her fear of flying. The character was built using a humanoid mechanim model and integrated with IBM Watson Unity SDK for speech recognition and OptiTrack Motion Capture for body movements.
<br/><br/>
The project was showcased at Goldsmiths' annual undergraduate computing show <a href="https://goldcomputing.show/2018/05/29/virtual-cognitive-behavioural-therapy/">GENERATION 2018.</a></p>
