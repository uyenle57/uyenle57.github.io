<p>Hello, good to see you here! 👋🏼
<br/><br/>
Born in Vietnam and currently in London working as a software engineer, I'm passionate in using technology and creativity to help solve real world problems.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work, I enjoy being outdoors, dancing, reading and cooking or just generally trying new things.
I also enjoy working on side projects where I built <a href="https://uyenle5796.github.io/howtoreduceplastic/">How To Reduce Plastic</a> to learn ReactJS and also hopefully to inspire others to reduce plastic consumption.
<br/><br/>
Feel free to drop me an email if you'd like to chat!
